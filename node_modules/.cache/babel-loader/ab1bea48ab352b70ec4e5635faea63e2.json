The function uses that to determine whether the\n          event name it is interested in is part of the event list for a given\n          day. Computer programming is essential in our world today, running the\n          systems for almost every device we use. Computer programming languages\n          allow us to tell machines what to do. Machines and humans “think” very\n          differently, so programming languages are necessary to bridge that\n          gap. The first computer programming language was created in 1883, when\n          a woman named Ada Lovelace worked with Charles Babbage on his very\n          early mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine. While Babbage was\n          concerned with simply computing numbers, Lovelace saw that the numbers\n          the computer worked with could represent something other than just\n          amounts of things. She wrote an algorithm for the Analytical Engine\n          that was the first of its kind. Because of her contribution, Lovelace\n          is credited with creating the first computer programming language. As\n          different needs have arisen and new devices have been created, many\n          more languages have followed.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: \"desc\",\n  props: {},\n};\n</script>\n"]}]}
