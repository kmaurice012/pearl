          Arrays have an includes method that checks whether a given value
          exists in the array. The function uses that to determine whether the
          event name it is interested in is part of the event list for a given
          day. Computer programming is essential in our world today, running the
          systems for almost every device we use. Computer programming languages
          allow us to tell machines what to do. Machines and humans “think” very
          differently, so programming languages are necessary to bridge that
          gap. The first computer programming language was created in 1883, when
          a woman named Ada Lovelace worked with Charles Babbage on his very
          early mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine. While Babbage was
          concerned with simply computing numbers, Lovelace saw that the numbers
          the computer worked with could represent something other than just
          amounts of things. She wrote an algorithm for the Analytical Engine
          that was the first of its kind. Because of her contribution, Lovelace
          is credited with creating the first computer programming language. As
          different needs have arisen and new devices have been created, many
          more languages have followed.
